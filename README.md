## Introduction

`rosbag2-web` enables web browsers to read the contents of ROS 2 SQLite files. It is currently being used in the [Foxglove Studio app](https://studio.foxglove.dev) to support reading data in this legacy file format. This SQLite format has been superseded by [MCAP](https://mcap.dev).
